### Plant-herbivore defense and Macroevolution
It has long been known that species interactions are critical to diversification. Herbivory can generate selective pressure on plants to become less palatable to herbivores and has led to the evolution of plant defenses through various morphological and chemical mechanisms. Leaves host numerous herbivorous interactions, while balancing beneficial interactions with those of natural enemies. The two main plant defenses are direct and indirect defenses, where direct defenses are plant characteristics that interact directly by prohibiting the herbivoreâ€™s ability to uses its host. Indirect plant defenses attract natural enemies of herbivores. Leaf morphology can protect against herbivores with both direct defenses (e.g. leaf thickness, hairs, trichomes, colleters, secondary metabolites, prickles), and indirect defenses (e.g. foliar domatia, extrafloral nectaries, or volatile organic compounds). The combination of these represent a composite defense strategy. Here, we aim to assess specific hypotheses regarding the evolution of plant-defense strategies, such as the univariate trade-off model, apparency theory, and escape and radiate (Agrawal 2007).

Many studies have proposed hypotheses for the evolution of plant defenses. Hypotheses are united under the assumption that plant defense allocation are products of natural selection. Some hypotheses include: 
1. **Apparency theory** posits that there are two broad classes of defense (quantitative and qualitative) and each defense predominates in one of two kinds of plants based on the severity of defense traits (apparent and unapparent) (Feeny 1976). 
2. The **optimal defense theory** posits that plants allocate resources to growth and defense depending on the selective pressure exerted by herbivores, availability of resources, and the cost of defense (Rhoades 1976). 
3. **Resource availability** assumes that the cost of defense varies with the availability of resources, and the relative importance of interspecific competition. Therefore, in resource poor areas plants will be slow-growing and allocate more resources to defense, whereas an area with high resources will have fast-growing plants that allocate more resources to growth for competition (Janzen 1974, Coley 1985). 
4. The **escape and radiate model** hypothesizes that antagonistic interactions lead to higher level associations between exploiters and exploited, and species diversification (Ehrlich and Raven 1964). 

Understanding defense strategies in a comparative phylogenetic framework will allow for inferences about how direct and indirect defense strategies can influence plant evolution.
